- Date: 2025-12-14
- Phase: 2  
- Week: 9
- Deload: No  
- Focus: Legs Hypertrophy  
- Duration: 167 min
## Exercise 1  
**Name:** Leg Press  
**Goal:** 250 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps  
**Rest:** 3 min   

### Warmup
1. 150 x feel - full possible depth
2. 200 x feel - full possible depth
3. 250 x feel
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid. 120 x feel - tried unilateral, explosives were very hard at this weight so did bilateral explosive 
### Working Sets 
1. 250 x 15 RPE 8.5
2. 250 x 15 RPE 8.5
3. 250 x 17 RPE 10 - great set

### Notes 
Work on form and use hands very lightly to protect knees until you have knee sleeves. Bracing core every rep really focuses on leg drive. And try to think about leg drive that really helps focus. 
### Cues  
- Seat height at 2.   
- Controlled negative and explosive positive  
- First set often feels heavy so do proper pyramid warmup. Any knee wobbling is not good, i think that means the quad is strong but the knee is not, for now hold on to them for safety but work on knee stability very lightly, dont stress them too much  
- Do without shoes for better grip

## Exercise 2  
**Name:** Seated Leg Curl   
**Goal:** 50 kg x 3 sets x 12-15 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   

### Warmup
1. 18 x feel - unilateral
2. 50 x feel 
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1. 50 x 16 RPE 8.5 perfect 
2. 50 x 17 RPE 8.5 perfect
3. 50 x 14 RPE 10 good failure:llp(8) - llp should be only from squeezing legs not using arm strength as much

### Notes 
Seat at 4, 5 visible. Goal 50x15
### Cues  
- Because we learnt that first sets are most important we should try to get a proper rpe 8-9 on first set and with every other set reps can decrease and rpe increase because of strict rest time period and that’s okay!  

## Exercise 3  
**Name:** Walking Lunge
**Goal:** 15 kg x 2 sets x 10-12 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min

### Notes
Careful with knee fatigue. We need to fix them before we killshot here.

3. 77 x 9+1 RPE 10 good

## Exercise 5  
**Name:** Cable Hip Adduction  
**Goal:** 15.9 kg x 3 sets x 12-15 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1. 15.9 x 12 RPE 9.5 
2. 15.9 x 12 RPE 10  - took rest between by pausing after 6 reps
3. 15.9 x 12 RPE 10 - took rest between by pausing after 6 reps
### Notes 
13.6 for 15 or 15.9 for 9 to 10 perfect reps is a good goal. 
### Cues  
- Brace your standing leg’s hip like in shoulder press to really lock in adductors.   
- Height set to 6, see Jeff’s form(controlled release hard pull).   
- Rotate pulling leg slightly inward and i felt more adductors.   
- Take more rest between legs, use a stand to rest pulling leg on when unclipping.   
- I start to feel lower back and rest of glutes in it so be careful when loading.   
- Control tempo on negative
## Exercise 6
**Name:** Cable Hip Abduction  
**Goal:** 9.1 kg x 3 sets x 12-15 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   
### Warm Up

### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1. 9.1 x 13 RPE 8
2. 9.1 x 12 RPE 9 - full rom cross legs
3. 9.1 x 12 RPE 10 
### Notes    
Felt so tired that had to just rest between legs and keep going. This is a good idea instead of going both legs together cuz i fall short of a few reps on second order leg. 

### Cues  
- Feel in outer thighs and glutes
- Think about kicking up, then you’d keep the hip stable.   
- Perfect form with controlled negative and explosive push.   
- see Jeff’s form in video  
- Go full range of motion by letting legs cross

## Exercise 7 
**Name:** Standing Calf Raise  
**Goal:** 130 kg x 3 sets x 12-15 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   
### Warm Up
1. 120 x feel - fast explosive tempo
### Working Sets 
1. 120 x 12 RPE 10 good 
2. 120 x 12 RPE 10 perfect - last rep was hard
3. 120 x 12 RPE 10 good failure:statichold(30)
### Notes 
120x 15 perfect reps is hypertrophic goal. Can barely do 12 reps perfect right now at 120. 
### Cues  
- I can keep more surface of my feet on the stepper, being more on toes pushed my knee to the limit.  
- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom.

**Goal:** 8 kg x 3 sets x 8-15 reps
### Working Sets
1. 8 x 12 good 
2. 8 x 12 RPE 10 good  
3. 8 x 12 RPE 10 learning - went with feeling on rotations and angles
### Notes
Don't put too much stress on joints, allow them to recover. Tried doing fast reps on concentric. 
### Cues
- go around the world
- Keep knee bent know, i have done enough with straight knee and my left knee is still hurting
