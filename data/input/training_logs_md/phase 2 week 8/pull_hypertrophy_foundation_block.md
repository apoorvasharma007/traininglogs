- Shrug up and in.  
- 2 sec pause at top and bottom.  
- don’t try to lean too much, around 30 degree lean from standing straight.  
- Go for 12 reps every set.  
- Use the straps for grip properly looping twice and flare elbow ever so slightly to cut out forearm and wrist, helped for a better squeeze.
