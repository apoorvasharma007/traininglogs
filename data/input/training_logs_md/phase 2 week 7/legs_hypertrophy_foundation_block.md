- Duration: 150 min
## Exercise 1  
**Name:** Leg Press  
**Goal:** 250 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps  
**Rest:** 3 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1. 250 x 15 RPE 8
2. 250 x  13 RPE 9
3. 250 x 21 RPE 10 - With Asif’s presence, last rep was a struggle 

### Notes 
Work on form and use hands very lightly to protect knees until you have knee sleeves
### Cues  
- Seat height at 2.   
- Controlled negative and explosive positive  
- First set often feels heavy so do proper pyramid warmup. Any knee wobbling is not good, i think that means the quad is strong but the knee is not, for now hold on to them for safety but work on knee stability very lightly, dont stress them too much  
- Do without shoes for better grip

## Exercise 2

### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets

2. 50 x 12 good 
3. 50 x 13 RPE 10 good failure:llp(7)
### Notes 
Seat at 4, 5 visible. Goal 50x15
### Cues  
- Because we learnt that first sets are most important we should try to get a proper rpe 8-9 on first set and with every other set reps can decrease and rpe increase because of strict rest time period and that’s okay!

### Notes
Careful with knee fatigue. We need to fix them before we killshot here.

### Notes 
13.6 for 12 or 15.9 for 9 to 10 perfect reps is a good goal. 
### Cues  
- Brace your standing leg’s hip like in shoulder press to really lock in adductors.   
- Height set to 6, see Jeff’s form(controlled release hard pull).   
- Rotate pulling leg slightly inward and i felt more adductors.   
- Take more rest between legs, use a stand to rest pulling leg on when unclipping.   
- I start to feel lower back and rest of glutes in it so be careful when loading.   
- Control tempo on negative
