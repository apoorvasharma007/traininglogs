Keyword aliases also needed here for robustness
parser should strip all whitespaces first
only parse text between "BEGIN:" and "END" blocks, which will always be uppercase

EX1: Name of exercise // alias for EX can be Exercise and the both keywords should be case insensitve, keyword followed by number is the number of the exercise
//optional
Goal: W kg x S sets x P-R reps // keywords goal, kg, sets, reps should be case insensitve
//optional
Rest: M min // keyword rest should be case insensitve

// warmup object is optional
W1: W x feel // alias for W can be WarmupSet and both keywords should be case insensitve,  keyword followed by number is the number of the exercise
W2: W x feel // keyword W  is warmup weight in kg and the word feel should be ignored, all keywords should be case insensitive
W3: W x N - note // keyword N is number of reps and should be case insensitive, "-" signifies there is a note for this warmup set and should be parsed as a single string even if it spans multiple lines

//optional
WarmupNotes: // WarmupNotes: is a keyword, should be case insensitive, it will be followed by a new line and the notes string which will be a multi line string
notesstring

// the below section is Working Set object and its required for each exercise
// the keywords are -
// S or Set followed by : followed by a number which makes the set number ; this is required always
// W is weight in kg; this is required always
// N is rep count; this is required always, it might be suceeded by an optional "+" character followed by another number which maps to partial rep count
// rpe is rpe; this is optional
// perfect, good, bad , learning are keywords and are optional
// "-" signifies there is a note for this set and should be parsed as a single string even if it spans multiple lines, and the note is optional in which case there will be no "-" on the line for the set
// failure is a keyword which maps to failure technique type followed by : followed by details of the failure technique; this is optional
// all keywords must be dealt in case insensitive manner
S1: WxN RPE Y perfect - note
S2: WxN RPE Z good - note
