## Exercise 1  
**Name:** Leg Press  
**Goal:** 250 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps  
**Rest:** 3 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1.  250 x 13 RPE 8 learning - rested hands on knee
2. 250 x  14 good - no palms used hold machine
3. 250 x 12 RPE 10 perfect - no palms ysed held machine

### Notes 
Work on form and use hands very lightly to protect knees until you have knee sleeves
### Cues  
- Seat height at 2.   
- Controlled negative and explosive positive  
- First set often feels heavy so do proper pyramid warmup. Any knee wobbling is not good, i think that means the quad is strong but the knee is not, for now hold on to them for safety but work on knee stability very lightly, dont stress them too much  
- Do without shoes for better grip

2. 50 x 14 RPE 10 good failure:llp(8)

### Notes 

### Cues  
- Because we learnt that first sets are most important we should try to get a proper rpe 8-9 on first set and with every other set reps can decrease and rpe increase because of strict rest time period and that’s okay!

- Rotate pulling leg slightly inward and i felt more adductors.   
- Take more rest between legs, use a stand to rest pulling leg on when unclipping.
