## Exercise 1
**Name:** Incline DB Press 45 Degree
**Goal:** 30kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 3 min
### Warmup
1. 0 x feel banded shoulder movement 
2. 0 x feel - around the world, lift ass off the bench or let the shoulders drop to extreme range of motion under load, keep breathing, rep count feeling based
3. 2.5 x feel - all shoulder range of motion
4. 20 x 6 - unilateral punches full range lift and twist lat also should use 17.5 
5. 25 x 4

### Warmup Notes
10 x feel - unilateral with rotation, massage the shoulder ball and socket joint by rotating elbows all around at bottom position, rep count feeling based. 20 x feel - unilateral without rotation, can go explosive and controlled descent or play with more time under tension with very slow reps to feel deepest muscles.
### Working Sets
1. 32.5 x 9 RPE 9 perfect
2. 32.5 x 8 RPE 9.5 perfect
3. 32.5 x 9 RPE 10 good 

### Notes
32.5 x 6 felt doable, left hand got stuck while setting up halfway lol. Held up like the superman. Be careful dont get injured.
### Cues
- brace core
- breathe every rep
- feet on the ground
- Lift DB from left as well as right when picking up for setup
- In ramp high volume block we wanna pause for a sec on bottom

## Exercise 2
**Name:** Pec Dec Single Arm
**Goal:** 100 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 55 x 9 - one heavy warmup, at top position of squeeze take arm out and in to feel all the pecs, do one light warmup for resilience 
### Warmup Notes
pyramid warmup
### Working Sets 
1. 100 x 11 RPE 8 good - explosive push and controlled negative 
2. 100 x 10 RPE 10 good - feels good in the chest
3. 100 x 10 RPE 10 - explosive push and slow negatives. 

### Notes
100 for 10 with explosive push and controlled negatives is feeling good.  
Left footing on last rep on right hand so its clear a lot of strength is coming from leg drive
### Cues
- the longer the path my arms take the better the squeeze
- No need to take arm all the way back here, go as far as chest is engaged particularly oj last set to go to failure, these reps are necessary to take chest to failure without putting stress on rotator cuff
- hold the squeeze for a sec
- can do one set with low cable position, one set with medium-height cable position, and one height with a high cable position. If you only have one or two sets, choose the one or two cable positions you prefer.

## Exercise 3
**Name:** Wide Grip Lat Pulldown
**Goal:** 55 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps.

1. 55 x 11 RPE 8 - grip failed without straps
2. 55 x 11 RPE 9 - grip felt better
3. 55 x 12  RPE 10 perfect - with strap could have done more 
### Notes
55x12 perfect is the goal. Felt mostly in lats. Need to focus on shoulder blades squeezing. 
### Cues
- use straps for killing lats
- drive elbows down squeeze shoulder blades together to feel Lats and mid back
- Lean back very slightly, too much leaning doesn’t engage mid back I guess

1. 6.8 x 12 RPE 8.5 perfect 
2. 9.1 x 5+2 RPE 10 good

### Notes
noticed left side is usually 0.5-1.5 rpe behind right. Felt hot in side delts. The pause at the top is a must. 
### Cues
- squeeze side delts to move weight

- Try to pause at the top for a sec

1. 50 x 12 RPE 8.5 good
2. 50 x 12 RPE 9.5 good
3. 50 x 10 RPE 10 failure:llp(3)- right back was slightly more engaged i guess cuz it pinched on top
### Notes
60x6 can be a good goal but need to get that shoulder squeeze. Or reduce weight to 55 and try 8 perfect reps. This time i faced the opposite way and really enjoyed pulling bar to chest cuz the angle of the rod makes it come to chest anyways. 
### Cues
- explosive pulls , come to chest every rep

3. 29.5 x 13 RPE 10 good 

### Notes
i used to be too slanted on these so now standing more upright enough to face front comfortably, lower the weight and work on technique now.  need to go heavier safely.
