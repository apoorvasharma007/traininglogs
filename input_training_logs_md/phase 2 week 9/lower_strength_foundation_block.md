## Exercise 1
**Name:** Seated Leg Hamstring Curl
**Goal:** 57 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral
2. 43 x feel 
### Working Sets
1. 57 x 11 RPE 9.5 good
2. 50 x 14 RPE 9 perfect - really good reps, squeeze in bottom position
3. 57 x RPE 10 good failure:llp(8) - today was better after two sets i was able to move this weight with good form

### Notes
struggling with set up at higher weight. me slipping forward is a big problem, didn’t get desired range of motion even though i could have
### Cues
* Bring the seat forward to see point 5 so set at 4
## Exercise 2
**Name:** Smith Machine Static Lunge with elevated front foot 
**Goal:** 15 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 5 min

### Warmup
1. 20 x feel - legs feel stiff, knees feel weak 

### Warmup Notes
Need proper warmup to actually get going. Progressive sets feel better on this. 

### Working Sets
1. 20 x 10 RPE 8 good - didnt fully cut out hind leg cuz of feeling stiff and knee pain
2. 20 x 10 RPE 9 good - except last few reps all were pretty perfect with mostly standing leg drive
3. 20 x 10 RPE 10 good - good set last rep was pretty much failure cuz had to use support of hind leg
### Notes
Didnt feel lower back after last set. I think 17.5 might be a good weight to aim for 10 reps. 
### Cues
- Emphasize front foot 
- stay more upright, adjust stepper position

## Exercise 3
**Name:** Hyperextension
**Goal:** 15 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 3 min
### Warmup
1. 0 x feel - did body weight with unilaterals too
### Warmup Notes
Pyramid warmup
### Working Sets
1. 15 x 10 RPE 8 - felt lower back too
2. 15 x 11 RPE 9.5 good - felt lower back on last few reps
3. 15 x 12 RPE 10 perfect - better than previous two sets. Do more warmup

### Notes
Can go heavier with good form, but increase weight slowly to avoid injury. imp to engage core by bracing and deep breath this helps target glutes much better and prevents lower back. Do more warmup. 
### Cues
- explosive up, controlled negative
- Hold top position to squeeze glutes
- engage core by bracing and deep breath


## Exercise 4
**Name:** Leg Extension
**Goal:** 77 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
2. 57 x feel
### Warmup Notes
Do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Still need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee. 
### Working Sets
1. 77 x 12 RPE 8.5 perfect 
2. 77 x 11 RPE 10 perfect
3. 77 x 10 + 1 RPE 10 perfect

### Notes

### Cues
- True failure is far from getting these reps, I can do reverse pyramids to get even better contraction and failure, my recovery might sustain that impact.

## Exercise 5
**Name:** Leg Press Calf Raise
**Goal:** 250 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup
1. 220 x feel

2. 250 x 8 RPE 10 perfect
3. 250 x 8 + 1 RPE 10 good failure:statichold(30) 
### Notes
Good form overall,  heavy but maintain perfect technique. Do 8 perfect reps first. Didnt do failure technique on last set. 
### Cues
- put safety clips
- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom of each rep

Hold up the plate and contract core fast like wrestlers do.
