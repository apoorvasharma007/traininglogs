2. 57 x 10 RPE 10 good failure : llp(8)

**Rest:** 5 min

### Warmup
1. 30 x feel
2. 40 x feel
3. 50 x feel
### Working Sets
1. 60 x 9 RPE 9.0 good - going very low put stress on knees
2. 60 x 10 RPE 9.5 perfect - controlled depth to protect knees 
3. 60 x 12 RPE 10 good - took more rest

### Notes
Knees feeling better today. Think they will recover at a slow pace. Rpe 8.5 means im sure i had another rep at least, could have had 2 more i dont know
## Exercise 3
**Name:** Barbell Romanian Deadlift
**Goal:** 90 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 3 min
### Warmup
1. 70 x 4
2. 80 x 4
### Warmup Notes
Pyramid warmup
### Working Sets
1. 90 x 10 RPE 9 perfect - grip failed 
2. 90 x 10 RPE 10 perfect - grip failing me so 3 reps normal grip and 4 and 3 with alternating power grip

### Notes
Couldn’t get tension on the hamstrings on majority reps. Set 2 was bad cuz straps were too tightly rolled and opened my palm under load. Set 3 could feel some tension on hamstrings. 
### Cues
- keep tension on the hamstrings.
- Move only at the hip hinge
- stay in the bottom 3/4 of the range of motion.

## Exercise 4
**Name:** Leg Extension
**Goal:** 77 kg x 2 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 18 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
2. 50 x feel
3. 63 x 3
4. 70 x 2 
### Warmup Notes
Learning to do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee. 
### Working Sets
1. 70 x 13 RPE 9 perfect
2. 77 x 10+1 RPE 10 perfect

### Notes
Since program calls for lesser sets and more intensity in foundation block, edit the goal accordingly.

**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup

2. 140 x 8 RPE 10 bad - unstable reps 
3. 130 x 8 RPE 10 good failure:statichold(30)
### Notes
might need to go a bit lighter at 125 to hold 1-2 sec at bottom for rep range
### Cues
- put safety clips
- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom of each rep

**Goal:** 22.7 kg x 2 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Working Sets
1. 24.9 x 11 RPE 7 good
2. 17.1 x 10 RPE 8 good - better ab contractions and bracing core helped a little to feel left abs too. 
### Notes
Need to go lighter to engage left abs as much as right abs. Lighter weight will also help get rid of grip issues. 
### Cues
- Sit ass back on heels
- See jeff’s form for full range of motion
- Keep mind muscle connection with abs
