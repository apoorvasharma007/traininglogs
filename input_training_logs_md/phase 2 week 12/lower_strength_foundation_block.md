- Deload: No
- Focus: Lower Strength
- Duration: 139 min

## Exercise 1

**Name:** Seated Leg Hamstring Curl
**Goal:** 57 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral
2. 50 x feel

### Working Sets
1. 57 x 15 RPE 8.5 perfect - first rep onwards good form, rest seems to have fixed weakness 
2. 57 x 13 RPE 9 perfect 
3. 57 x 13 RPE 10 good failure:llp(10) - the catch was height at 2 around the hip anchor, setting it to 1 made first rep partial to setup
  
### Notes
At 57 i have to use my hands and the rest of me more to get reps in but 50 is quite easy to isolate hamstrings. Keep pushing at 57 until they start to get easier. first rep is sometimes the bottleneck, it was partial but then we get in the groove. Set seat at 4 points (5 visible) , hips at 2 (3 visible) and calves at 3 

### Cues
* Bring the seat forward to see point 5 so set at 4

## Exercise 2

**Name:** Smith Machine Static Lunge with elevated front foot
**Goal:** 20 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 5 min

### Warmup
1. 20 x feel

### Warmup Notes
Need proper warmup to actually get going. Progressive sets feel better on this.

  
### Working Sets
1. 20 x 13 RPE 8.5 good - didn’t try my best to cut hind leg 
2. 20 x 12 RPE 9 good - 
3. 20 x 12 RPE 9 good - Feeling good in legs and very slightly in lower back. 

### Notes
Didnt feel lower back after last set. I think 17.5 might be a good weight to aim for 10 reps. Cut off hind leg as much as possible. Make this feel like pistol squats. 

### Cues
- Emphasize front foot
- stay more upright, adjust stepper position

## Exercise 3

**Name:** Hyperextension
**Goal:** 15 kg x 4 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 3 min

### Warmup
1. 0 x feel - did body weight with unilaterals too

### Warmup Notes
Pyramid warmup

### Working Sets
1. 15 x 12 RPE 9 good - felt my entire back today, very weak on this now
2. 15 x 12 RPE 9 good
3. 15 x 12 RPE 9.5 perfect
4. 15 x 12 RPE 9.5 perfect - engage core to protect lower back fatigue

### Notes
Can go heavier with good form, but increase weight slowly to avoid injury. imp to engage core by bracing and deep breath this helps target glutes much better and prevents lower back. Do more warmup if feeling lowerback.

### Cues
- explosive up, controlled negative
- Hold top position to squeeze glutes
- engage core by bracing and deep breath
  

## Exercise 4

**Name:** Leg Extension
**Goal:** 77 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
2. 57 x feel

### Warmup Notes
Do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Still need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee.

### Working Sets
1. 77 x 12 RPE 9.5 good - feeling tired due to smoking
2. 77 x 11 + 1 RPE 10 good
3. 77 x 12 RPE 10 good 
  
### Notes
  

### Cues
- True failure is far from getting these reps, I can do reverse pyramids to get even better contraction and failure, my recovery might sustain that impact.


## Exercise 5

**Name:** Leg Press Calf Raise
**Goal:** 250 kg x 4 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup
1. 200 x feel

### Working Sets
1. 250 x 11 RPE 9.5 bad 
2. 250 x 12 RPE 10 good
3. 250 x 12 RPE 10 good failure:statichold(30)

### Notes
Good form overall, heavy but maintain perfect technique. Do 8 perfect reps first. Didnt do failure technique on last set.

### Cues
- put safety clips
- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom of each rep 

## Exercise 6

**Name:** Decline Weighted Crunch
**Goal:** 10 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min

### Working Sets
1. 10 x 20 good
2. 10 x 15 RPE 9 good
3. 10 x 15 RPE 10 - braced core entire time and got a crazy spike in abs

### Notes
Hold up the plate and contract core fast like wrestlers do.

### Cues
- engage left abs equally
- Keep mind muscle connection with abs

## Exercise 7

**Name:** Tibialis Raise Single Leg
**Goal:** 8 kg x 3 sets x 1-15 reps

### Working Sets
1. 8 x 15 good - bent knee and hanging it from arm instead of bench support
2. 8 x 15 good
3. 8 x 15 RPE 10 good

### Notes
Don't put too much stress on joints, allow them to recover. Tried doing fast reps on concentric.

### Cues
- go around the world
