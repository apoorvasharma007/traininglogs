**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral
2. 29 x feel - unilateral partials
### Working Sets
1. 57 x 11 RPE 9.5 good
2. 57 x 10 RPE 10 bad failure:llp(7) - me slipping forward is a big problem, didn’t get desired range of motion even though i could have

## Exercise 2
**Name:** Smith Machine Static Lunge with elevated front foot 
**Goal:** 15 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 5 min

### Warmup

### Working Sets
1. 10 x 13 RPE 9 good 
2. 15 x 11 RPE 9 good
3. 20 x 9 RPE 10 good - couldn’t do perfect but good weight

### Notes
Didnt feel lower back after last set. I think 17.5 might be a good weight to aim for 10 reps. 
### Cues
- Emphasize front foot 
- stay more upright, adjust stepper position

## Exercise 3
**Name:** Hyperextension
**Goal:** 15 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 3 min

Pyramid warmup

1. 15 x 11 RPE 9 
2. 15 x 11 RPE 9.5 good
3. 15 x 12 RPE 10 perfect - engage core by bracing and deep breath

### Notes
Can go heavier with good form, but increase weight slowly to avoid injury

### Cues
- explosive up, controlled negative
- Hold top position to squeeze glutes

## Exercise 4
**Name:** Leg Extension
**Goal:** 77 kg x 3 sets x 10-12 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
2. 57 x feel
### Warmup Notes
Do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Still need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee. 
### Working Sets
1. 77 x 10 RPE 8.5 good - slow on eccentric
2. 77 x 10 RPE 10 perfect
3. 77 x 10 + 1 RPE 10 perfect

### Notes

### Cues
- True failure is far from getting these reps, I can do reverse pyramids to get even better contraction and failure, my recovery might sustain that impact.

**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup

- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom of each rep
