## Exercise 1
**Name:** Seated Leg Hamstring Curl
**Goal:** 63 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 23 x feel - unilateral
2. 29 x feel - unilateral couldnt move aim is partial reps
3. 57 x feel - both legs, felt heavy
### Working Sets
1. 63 x 0 + 8 RPE 10 bad - only few reps were good range
2. 63 x 0 + 9 RPE 10 bad - all reps were partial


### Notes
Strength increasing on hamstring curls but at 57 wasn’t able to do perfect 10 reps range of motion wise, was struggling after 6-7 reps to get to the bottom. But today set one was really good! We are improving again! We are good with 57 for 10 i hope lets get 57 for 15 and 63 for 8 to 10. Tried pushing away the machine for a change but struggled due to change in form. 
## Exercise 2
**Name:** Smith Machine Squat
**Goal:** 70 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 5 min

### Warmup
1. 40 x feel
2. 60 x feel
### Working Sets
1. 70 x 6 RPE 10 perfect 
2. 70 x 6 RPE 10 perfect - very good depth

### Notes
Next week is deload and then ramp block but i can go heavier here in phase 3. Knees feeling better today. Think they will recover at a slow pace. Rpe 8.5 means im sure i had another rep at least, could have had 2 more i dont know

## Exercise 3
**Name:** Barbell Romanian Deadlift
**Goal:** 80 kg x 3 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 3 min
### Warmup
1. 70 x 6

### Warmup Notes
Pyramid warmup
### Working Sets
1. 90 x 7 RPE 8 - deficit of 10  plate felt great
2. 90 x 6 + 1 RPE 10 perfect - grip failed me, use chalk next time


### Notes
Keep going after grip fails by dropping the bar taking a deep breath and push into the ground. Didn’t use straps.  

### Cues
- keep tension on the hamstrings.
- Move only at the hip hinge
- stay in the bottom 3/4 of the range of motion.
- Use deficit of 20 and 10 plate

## Exercise 4
**Name:** Leg Extension
**Goal:** 104 kg x 2 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Warmup
1. 36 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
### Warmup Notes
Learning to do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee. 
### Working Sets
1. 104 x 10 RPE 10 good
2. 104 x 8 RPE 10 good - almost getting to effective tempo control on this 

### Notes
Since program calls for lesser sets and more intensity in foundation block, edit the goal accordingly.

## Exercise 5
**Name:** Standing Calf Raise
**Goal:** 130 kg x 2 sets x 6-8 reps
**Rest:** 2 min

### Warmup
1. 110 x feel
2. 120 x feel
### Working Sets
1. 130 x 9 RPE 9.5 good 
2. 130 x 10 RPE 10 perfect 

### Notes
Good form overall 
### Cues
- put safety clips
- 1-2 sec pause at the bottom of each rep

## Exercise 6
**Name:** Cable Crunch
**Goal:** 22.7 kg x 2 sets x 8-10 reps
**Rest:** 2 min
### Working Sets
1. 22.7 x 15 RPE 7 good
2. 22.7 x 15 RPE 7 good - better ab contractions and bracing core helped a little to feel left abs too. 
### Notes
Need to go lighter to engage left abs as much as right abs. Lighter weight will also help get rid of grip issues. Keep working on figuring out how to initiate movement from core not hands
### Cues
- Sit ass back on heels
- See jeff’s form for full range of motion
- Keep mind muscle connection with abs
## Exercise 7
**Name:** Tibialis Raise Single Leg
**Goal:** 12 kg x 2 sets x 1-15 reps
### Working Sets
1. 12 x 12 learning - went around the world
2. 12 x 8 + 2 RPE 10 good - strict raises
### Notes
Didnt put too much stress on joints, allowing them to recover 
### Cues
- go around the world
