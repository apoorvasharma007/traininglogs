## Exercise 1  
**Name:** Leg Press  
**Goal:** 250 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps  
**Rest:** 3 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1.  250 x 8 RPE 9.5 learning
2. 250 x 6 - learning
### Notes 
250 added to press for 15 reps in week 12. Im adding weight too fast for my knees to tolerate. 250 for 8 with absolutely perfect form is hard enough with very little knee pain or wobbling. 

### Cues  
- Seat height at 2.   
- Controlled negative and explosive positive  
- First set often feels heavy so do proper pyramid warmup. Any knee wobbling is not good, i think that means the quad is strong but the knee is not, for now hold on to them for safety but work on knee stability very lightly, dont stress them too much  

## Exercise 2  
**Name:** Seated Leg Curl   
**Goal:** 50 kg x 2 sets x 10-12 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 

### Notes 
43 for 13 plus reps for 4 sets in week 12. 
### Cues  
- Because we learnt that first sets are most important we should try to get a proper rpe 8-9 on first set and with every other set reps can decrease and rpe increase because of strict rest time period and that’s okay!

2. 13.6 x 10 - felt easy after getting warmed up
### Notes 
13.6 for 13 to 17 reps for 3 sets in week 12, adjust goal accordingly. Need proper warmup to be able to execute at higher intensity. 
### Cues  
- Brace your standing leg’s hip like in shoulder press to really lock in adductors.   
- Height set to 6, see Jeff’s form(controlled release hard pull).   
- Rotate pulling leg slightly inward and i felt more adductors.   
- Take more rest between legs, use a stand to rest pulling leg on when unclipping.   
- I start to feel lower back and rest of glutes in it so be careful when loading.
