### Notes
Strength increasing on hamstring curls but at 57 wasn’t able to do perfect 10 reps range of motion wise, was struggling after 6-7 reps to get to the bottom. But today set one was really good! We are improving again!

3. 60 x 12 RPE 10 perfect

### Notes
Next week is deload and then ramp block but i can go heavier here in phase 3. Knees feeling better today. Think they will recover at a slow pace. Rpe 8.5 means im sure i had another rep at least, could have had 2 more i dont know

2. 90 x 8 RPE 10 perfect - grip failed at 8 reps but two more reps with dropping bar. 
3. 90 x 6+1 RPE 10 

### Notes
Keep going after grip fails by dropping the bar taking a deep breath and push into the ground. Didn’t use straps.  

### Cues
- keep tension on the hamstrings.
- Move only at the hip hinge
- stay in the bottom 3/4 of the range of motion.

## Exercise 4

1. 18 x feel - unilateral with alternating leg
2. 50 x feel
3. 63 x 3
4. 70 x 2 
### Warmup Notes
Learning to do unilateral explosives with alternating leg as an experiment. These hurt the knee which is overworked, currently left knees front side bottom point. Need to find out what that is. Did less unilateral sets today since they were stressing the left knee. 
### Working Sets
1. 70 x 13 RPE 9 perfect
2. 77 x 9+1 RPE 10 perfect

### Notes
Since program calls for lesser sets and more intensity in foundation block, edit the goal accordingly.

**Rest:** 2 min
### Working Sets
1. 18 x 20 RPE 7 good
2. 20 x 18 RPE 7 good - better ab contractions and bracing core helped a little to feel left abs too. 
### Notes
Need to go lighter to engage left abs as much as right abs. Lighter weight will also help get rid of grip issues. Keep working on figuring out how to initiate movement from core not hands
### Cues
- Sit ass back on heels
- See jeff’s form for full range of motion
- Keep mind muscle connection with abs
