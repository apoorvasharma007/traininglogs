## Exercise 1  
**Name:** Leg Press  
**Goal:** 280 kg x 3 sets x 8-10 reps  
**Rest:** 3 min   
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid. 200 kgs power kicks. 
### Working Sets 
1. 270 x 10 RPE 9 perfect - sitting back holding handles made me feel weaker
2. 270 x 10 RPE 9 perfect - holding machine makes me stronger 
3. 270 x 12 RPE 9.5 perfect - sitting back holding handles lightly trying to put max force from legs 
### Notes 
Work on form and use hands very lightly to protect knees until you have knee sleeves
### Cues  
- Seat height at 2.   
- Controlled negative and explosive positive  
- First set often feels heavy so do proper pyramid warmup. Any knee wobbling is not good, i think that means the quad is strong but the knee is not, for now hold on to them for safety but work on knee stability very lightly, dont stress them too much  
- Do without shoes for better grip

## Exercise 2  
**Name:** Seated Leg Curl   
**Goal:** 57 kg x 2 sets x 10-12 reps  
**Rest:** 2 min   

### Warmup

3. 57 x feel
### Warmup Notes  
Pyramid   
### Working Sets 
1. 57 x 13 RPE 9.5 perfect
2. 57 x 14 RPE 10 perfect - start the set with subtle kickbacks to initiate first rep

### Notes 
57 for 15 with perfect form is a good goal

### Cues  
- Because we learnt that first sets are most important we should try to get a proper rpe 8-9 on first set and with every other set reps can decrease and rpe increase because of strict rest time period and that’s okay!

3. 18.1 x 10 RPE 10 bad - no control on negative, almost impossible to control it
### Notes 
15.9 for 15 or 18.1 for 10 perfect reps is a good goal
### Cues  
- Brace your standing leg’s hip like in shoulder press to really lock in adductors.   
- Height set to 6, see Jeff’s form(controlled release hard pull).   
- Rotate pulling leg slightly inward and i felt more adductors.   
- Take more rest between legs, use a stand to rest pulling leg on when unclipping.
